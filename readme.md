# Script used to query Splunk API to get UserName / IP Correlation

There is a little bit of wonkyness with installing the splunk-sdk and pyscopg2 with the requirments.txt file on Scrutinizer installs. Not sure why but you can get around this with. 


pip3 install psycopg2-binary
pip3 install splunk-sdk
